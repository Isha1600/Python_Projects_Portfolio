        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **System Architecture and Composition**: The library management system is built upon three distinct classes (`Book`, `Member`, `Library`), effectively demonstrating object-oriented principles. The `Library` class utilizes composition by containing lists of `Book` and `Member` objects, managing the overall collection. Similarly, the `Member` class uses composition to track books borrowed by a specific member via its `borrowed_books` list.\n",
        "*   **Encapsulation**: Each class encapsulates its data and behavior. For instance, the `Book` class manages its `is_available` status internally through `borrow_book()` and `return_book()` methods, preventing direct external manipulation of its state. The `Library` class orchestrates interactions, ensuring that borrowing and returning books adhere to established rules and update the states of both `Book` and `Member` objects correctly.\n",
        "*   **List Comprehension**: The `Member` class effectively uses list comprehension within its `__str__` method to concisely generate a list of titles for books currently borrowed by the member (e.g., `[book.title for book in self.borrowed_books]`).\n",
        "*   **Search Logic**: Robust search functionalities are implemented within the `Library` class. The `search_book()` method allows case-insensitive searches based on a book's title or author, while `search_member()` performs case-insensitive searches by member name. For example, a search for \"lord\" successfully identified \"'The Hobbit'\" and \"'The Lord of the Rings'\".\n",
        "*   **Borrow/Return System**: A comprehensive borrow/return mechanism is central to the system.\n",
        "    *   The `Library.borrow_book()` method ensures a book is available before it can be borrowed, preventing scenarios where an already borrowed book is assigned to another member (e.g., \"Bob could not borrow 'The Hobbit'\" because \"Alice\" had already borrowed it).\n",
        "    *   The `Library.return_book()` method verifies that the specified member has indeed borrowed the book before processing the return.\n",
        "    *   Demonstrations showed successful borrowing of \"'The Hobbit'\" and \"'Pride and Prejudice'\" by \"Alice\" and the subsequent return of \"'The Hobbit'\", with corresponding updates to book availability and member's borrowed lists.\n",
